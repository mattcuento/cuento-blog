Day after day I tend to find myself losing track of all the interesting articles and blogs that I come across. This is an informal collection of resources that I find interesting and worth revisiting (or plan to read eventually).

I will try to keep this list updated as I find new resources. If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out!
