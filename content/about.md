I'm a software engineer with 3 years of experience in cloud infrastructure and distributed systems. I have a passion for open source software in the data space, particularly data processing and storage.

I began my journey in computer science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where I earned a B.S. in Software Engineering. During my time there, I delved into various aspects of software development. My first software job was maintaining
Cal Poly's student organization websites; I had the opportunity to build web applications including a applicant tracking system for student government candidates and an event planning application for student organizations.

After graduation, I joined a FinTech startup, Ridgeline, where I built an event platform and CDC pipelines on top of Apache Kafka and PostgreSQL that powered report generation and an online data platform. I gained my passion for distributed systems here, and 
learned much about the challenges of building scalable and reliable systems in a cloud environment. I found some of the open source projects in the data space to handle many of the challenges of reliability and scale incredibly fascinating; that's how I became
so invested in the space!

Three years later, I joined Confluent as a member of the Flink SQL team, diving deeper into the world of distributed data processing. I currently work on the Flink SQL and Table APIs and our platform surrounding them. I'm still brand new to Flink, but I'm excited to see where it takes me :)
